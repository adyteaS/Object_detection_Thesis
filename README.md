# Object_detection_Thesis
This is repository for me to keep track of my thesis work on object detection.
Currently, I am comparing different ML approaches to detection of specific objects. 
Binary class. Thinking of Stacking, custom-trained YOLO detector, PCA (principle component analysis), regular old CNNS, etc.
